rationale_interpretation: "The target \"By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix\" impacts all three dimensions of sustainable development. Renewable energy technologies represent a major element in strategies for greening economies everywhere in the world and for tackling the critical global problem of climate change. A number of definitions of renewable energy exist; what they have in common is highlighting as renewable all forms of energy that their consumption does not deplete their availability in the future. These include solar, wind, ocean, hydropower, geothermal resources, and bioenergy (in the case of bioenergy, which can be depleted, sources of bioenergy can be replaced within a short to medium-term frame). Importantly, this indicator focuses on the amount of renewable energy actually consumed rather than the capacity for renewable energy production, which cannot always be fully utilized. By focusing on consumption by the end user, it avoids the distortions caused by the fact that conventional energy sources are subject to significant energy losses along the production chain."

indicator_name: "Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption"
target: "By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix."
indicator_definition: "The renewable energy share in total final consumption is the percentage of final consumption of energy that is derived from renewable resources. It is calculated by dividing consumption of energy from all renewable sources by total final energy consumption. Renewable energy consumption includes consumption from: hydro, solid biofuels, wind, solar, liquid biofuels, biogas, geothermal, marine and waste. Total final consumption of energy is calculated from national balances and statistics as total final consumption minus non-energy use. Renewable energy consumption is derived from three tables of the IEA world energy statistics and balances: total final consumption, electricity output and heat output. All volumes reported in the total final consumption table are taken as reported. Since volumes for electricity and heat in the final consumption table are not broken down by technology, electricity and heat output tables are used instead to break down final consumption of electricity and heat by technology. The allocation by technology is done by deriving the share of technology in electricity and heat output tables and multiplying that share by final energy consumption of electricity and heat, respectively. For instance, if total final consumption table reports 150 TJ for waste energy, while total final consumption of electricity is 400 TJ and heat 100 TJ, and the share of waste in total electricity output is 10 percent and 5 percent in heat, the total reported number for waste consumption will be 195 TJ (150 TJ+400TJ*10%+100TJ*5%). The Global Tracking Framework Report (2013) provides more details on the suggested methodology for defining and measuring renewable energy (Chapter 4, Section 1, page 201-202)."
