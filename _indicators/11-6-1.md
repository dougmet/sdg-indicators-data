rationale_interpretation: "Recycling and reusing solid waste is a way to reduce the amount of waste to be disposed in landfills. A prosper city seeks to recycle the most part of its solid waste to increase the lifespan of its landfills and to profit solid waste as much as possible."

indicator_name: "Proportion of urban solid waste regularly collected and with adequate final discharge out of total urban solid waste generated, by cities"
target: "By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management."
indicator_definition: "The recycling rate is the tonnage recycled from municipal waste divided by the total municipal waste arising. Recycling includes material recycling, composting and anaerobic digestion. Municipal waste consists to a large extent of waste generated by households, but may also include similar wastes generated by small businesses and public institutions and collected by the municipality; this latter part of municipal waste may vary from municipality to municipality and from country to country, depending on the local waste management system (Eurostat, 2013)"
