  By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them
  sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of
  clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with
  all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities
indicator_definition: >-
  CO2 emission per unit of value added is a ratio indicator between the carbon
  emission and value added. Carbon emission is estimated from the data on energy
  consumption.

  CO2 emissions (in kilotonnes) divided by gross value added (GVA) chained
  volume measure (CVM).
national_indicator_description: >-
  Units of CO2 emitted used per unit of GVA (CVM), as an indicator of energy
  efficiency by sector. The Chained Volume Measures are created from the short
  term measures of output. The majority of indicators in the short term measures
  are measuring changes in output as a proxy for changes in GVA. At the
  reference year (currently 2015) the values are set equal to current price GVA
  values.
