rationale_interpretation: "People and businesses need access to financial services that are safe, reliable, and convenient. The high costs of providing these services, particularly to those living and working in more remote areas or for those whose transaction values are low, have led to limited access. New technologies and delivery channels are lowering costs and bringing timely and appropriate services to even more people, but require the institutions providing or partnering to provide services to have the capability to design and deliver these services."
