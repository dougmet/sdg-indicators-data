  Has the US established climate change mitigation, adaption and impact
  reduction into its primary, secondary, and tertiary educational curricula? 
us_method_of_computation: >-
  Since the United States has a federal education system there is no nationally
  designated curricula for public or private schools.  While schools typically
  do cover some aspects of climate change science, we believe there are wide
  ranges in the scope and intensity of these curricula across state and local
  jurisdictions that make curricula decisions.
