We are still looking for a suitable data source for this indicator. Please contact us if you think you can help by emailing <a href="mailto:SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk">SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk</a>.

In the future we plan to split this category so we can show you which indicators represent data gaps are currently in development and which are still left to look at.
