rationale_interpretation: "The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2013 calls for national governments to adopt and implement national DRR strategies with their own targets, indicators and timeframes. \nImpacts of climate change on sustainable development are observed through both slow-onset events (e.g. sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat and related impacts, salinization, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and desertification) and extreme weather events. \nCities around the world, as well as rural populations, witness growing disaster risks. Impacts of climate change on sustainable development are observed through both slow-onset events (e.g. sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat and related impacts, salinization, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and desertification) and extreme weather events. \nCities are some of the most vulnerable areas to natural disasters. Unplanned urban development (e.g. informal settlements, overcrowding, inadequate infrastructures) exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts and hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. Over half of all coastal areas are urbanized and 21 of the world's 33 mega cities lie in coastal flood zones. SIDS and coastal regions are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due to the undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate capacity to adapt. Poor urban populations must often resort to unsustainable coping strategies and mechanisms. \nLarge numbers of people remain perilously close to falling into poverty, experiencing shocks that they are unable to cope with. For the poor, a shock of even a relatively short impact and duration can have long term consequences. Several dimensions of poverty are closely related to environment, which is often affected by natural disasters. Better management of natural resources can themselves strengthen the resilience of the poor, by both reducing the likelihood of natural hazard events and offering resources to help cope with them. \nThese challenges require enhanced vulnerability and impact assessments, mitigation and adaptation plans, resilience building and DRR strategies. It is necessary to adapt to climate change, enhance resilience of ecosystems, and reduce disaster risk and build resilience to natural disasters. \nProactive DRR strategies will address climate change impact and enhance resilience of nations. Resilient infrastructures will be critical part of such strategies because infrastructures such as health, education, road and other critical infrastructures will have direct impact on reducing inequality and making growth more inclusive. \nIncreasing number of national governments that adopt and implement national DRR strategies will contribute to sustainable development from economic, environmental and social perspectives. \nThe indicator will build bridge between the SDGs and the Sendai Framework for DRR because the adoption of national DRR strategies is one of Sendai Framework targets and will be also monitored under the Sendai Framework Monitoring System. \n(mainly based on TST Issue Brief 23, 12 and 20)"

indicator_name: "Number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies"
target: "Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries."
indicator_definition: "National DRR strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030: national disaster risk reduction strategies and plans, across different timescales with targets, indicators and time frames, aimed at preventing the creation of risk, the reduction of existing risk and the strengthening of economic, social, health and environmental resilience (Sendai Framework, para 27(b)). In the Sendai Framework, link with DRR and climate change adaptation is strongly advocated. Note: the DRR strategies need to be based on risk information and assessments. Country: A nation with its own government, occupying a particular territory 	Note: Terminology will be discussed and finalized in the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group for Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction."
