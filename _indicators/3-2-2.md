indicator_name: "Neonatal mortality rate"
target: "By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births."
indicator_definition: "Probability that a child born in a specific year or period will die during the first 28 completed days of life if subject to age_specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births. Neonatal deaths (deaths among live births during the first 28 completed days of life) may be subdivided into early neonatal deaths, occurring during the first 7 days of life, and late neonatal deaths, occurring after the 7th day but before the 28th completed day of life."

method_of_computation: "Number of children who died during the first 28 days of life / Number of live births \nMethod of measurement \nData from civil registration: The number of live births and the number of neonatal deaths are used to calculate age_ specific rates. This system provides annual data. \nData from household surveys: Calculations are based on full birth history, whereby women are asked for the date of birth of each of their children, whether each child is still alive and if not the age at death. \nMethod of estimation \nThe United Nation Inter_agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN_IGME) produces neonatal mortality rate estimates with a Bayesian spline regression model which models the ratio of neonatal mortality rate / (under_five mortality rate'_'neonatal mortality rate). Estimates of NMR are obtained by recombining the estimates of the ratio with UN IGME_estimated under_five mortality rate. See UN IGME for more details. \nPredominant type of statistics: adjusted and estimated. \nThese neonatal mortality rates have been estimated by applying methods to the available data from all Member States in order to ensure comparability across countries and time; hence they are not necessarily the same as the official national data."
