rationale_interpretation: "Women participate in politics and decision-making at all levels, in different functions and across all spheres of government. They may participate as voters, candidates for local, regional and national elections, members of parliament or local council, heads of state and government, ministers, members of political parties, trade unions or business associations, or as electoral administrators. \nCapturing an accurate assessment of women's representation across these different forms of political participation has been difficult, however. The standard measure of women's political participation and involvement in decision-making, used to track progress for the Millennium Development Goals, was the proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments. In many respects, the existence and quality of this data has meant that other areas of political participation have not been paid sufficient attention. \nMeasuring women's participation in local government is an additional, but equally important measure of women's political participation and decision-making, because of the responsibilities of local governments and the significantly higher number of opportunities (that is seats) available to women candidates at this level. Women's entry into local politics has the potential to influence a wide range of policy decisions and local community programmes. \nHowever, the available data is limited; it is neither comprehensive across all countries, nor regularly updated. Data from the United Nations Statistical Division's 2010 edition of The World's Women, for example, show selected regional averages, with a low of 8 percent in Northern Africa to a high of 30 percent in sub-Saharan Africa. Averages across Latin America and Europe ranged from 24 to 29 percent and Asia reported averages below 20 percent. Drawing meaningful conclusions from this data is therefore difficult. \nIn 1995, the Beijing Platform for Action called on governments to accept a wider understanding of women's participation in decision-making that went beyond women in national politics. The 20-year review of the Platform, however, found that: \n\ta significant challenge for effectively monitoring progress towards gender equality is the lack of high quality and comparable data, collected over time. Many areas of statistics that are of critical importance such as ' women's participation in decision-making at all levels, including local government ' are still not produced regularly by countries. Data and statistical requirements for the post-2015 development agenda will be substantial, particularly for monitoring gender equality, women's empowerment and the human rights of women and girls in the new framework. \nA dedicated indicator on women's political participation would provide the necessary 'data mandate' to ensure this data set is more systematically collected across all countries and regularly monitored over time, allowing for both international and longitudinal comparisons."
