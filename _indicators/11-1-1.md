Actual indicator is percentage of occupied housing units in urban areas that are moderately inadequate, severely inadequate, and all inadequate.

Source is American Housing Survey national samples, 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013 (http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs.html).  Note that this survey is conducted in odd-numbered years only.  2015 data are not yet available.  

Urban is defined using the AHS METRO3 variable as any of:
- Central city of metropolitan area (METRO3 = '1')
- Inside metropolitan area but not in central city - urban (METRO3 = '2')
- Outside metropolitan area, urban (METRO3 = '4)
- Inside metropolitan area, unspecified (Charlotte only) (METRO3 = '9')

Moderately and Severely Inadequate are defined using the AHS ZADEQ variable, where ZADEQ = '2' for moderately inadequate and ZADEQ = '3' for severely inadequate.  This variable is based on these criteria:

ZADEQ =
Recoded adequacy of housing
1 adequate
2 moderately inadequate
3 severely inadequate
B or -6 Not applicable

If the unit meets just one of the following conditions:
 Unit has less than 2 full bathrooms (BATHS < 2) and the unit has at
least one of the following:
o Unit does not have hot and cold running water (HOTPIP=’2')
o Unit does not have a bathtub or shower (TUB=’2')
o Unit does not have a flush toilet (TOILET=’2')
o Unit shares plumbing facilities (SHARPF=’1')
 Unit was cold for 24 hours or more (FREEZE = '1') and there have been
more than 2 breakdowns of the heating equipment that lasted longer than 6
hours (NUMCOLD is '3', ‘4',’5',’6',’7',or ‘8)
 Electricity is not used (BUYE = '1')
 Unit has exposed wiring (NOWIRE = '2') and not every room has
working electrical plugs (PLUGS = '2') and the fuses have blown more than
twice(NUMBLOW is '3', ‘4',’5',’6',’7',or ‘8')
then assign ZADEQ as severely inadequate (ZADEQ=’3')

Determine how many of the following conditions the unit meets:
Unit has had outside water leaks in the last 12 months (LEAK = '1')
Unit has had inside water leaks in the last 12 months (ILEAK = '1')
Unit has holes in the floor (HOLES = '1')
Unit has open cracks wider than a dime (CRACKS='1')
Unit has an area of peeling paint larger than 8 x 11 (BIGP = '1')
Rats have been seen recently in the unit (RATS = '1')
 If the unit meets 5 or 6 of the conditions, then assign ZADEQ
as severely inadequate (ZADEQ=’3')

 If the unit meets 3 or 4 of the conditions and has not been
identified as being severely inadequate (ZADEQ=’3'), then
assign ZADEQ as moderately inadequate (ZADEQ=’2')

If the unit has not been identified as being severely inadequate
(ZADEQ=’3') and meets one of the following conditions:
 There have been more than 2 breakdowns of the toilet that lasted
longer than 6 hours (NUMTLT is '3', ‘4',’5',’6',’7',or ‘8)
 The main heating equipment is unvented room heaters burning kerosene,
gas, or oil (HEQUIP = 7)
 The unit is lacking complete kitchen facilities (KITCHEN = '2')
then assign ZADEQ as moderately inadequate (ZADEQ=’2')
