indicator_name: "Coverage of essential health services (defined as the average coverage of essential services based on tracer interventions that include reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases and service capacity and access, among the general and the most disadvantaged population)"
target: "Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all."
indicator_definition: "Tracer interventions for promotion and prevention services include: family planning coverage (need satisfied), antenatal care (at least four visits),''vaccination, non_use of tobacco, improved water source, adequate sanitation'' and other locally relevant coverage indicators \nTracer interventions for treatment services include: skilled birth attendance, antiretroviral therapy, tuberculosis treatment (case detection and''treatment success), hypertension treatment, diabetes treatment, pneumonia treatment in children and other locally relevant indicators"

method_of_computation: "Number of people receiving the intervention'/ Number of people who need the intervention \nMethod of measurement \nUniversal health coverage means that people receive the services they need, without incurring financial hardship. Countries progressively realize UHC according to their level of development, epidemiological situation, health system and people's expectations.''The indicators ideally cover promotion, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and palliation. There are a number of indicators that all countries implement such as immunization coverage or skilled attendance at birth that can be used for a summary measure of progress that can be used at lgobal and regional and country levels. Countries however will also create their own set of indicators to track progress towards UHC.'' \nThe selection of indicators is based on the initial framework, and was applied in the global report published in 2015 by WHO and the World Bank.''This provides a basis for further improvements working alongside countries. \nMethod of estimation \nThe indicators can be expressed as a summary measure. These can be weighted according to indicator, or intervention area. Work on incorporating an equity component in the summary measure is ongoing but is possible in a relatively simple manner."
