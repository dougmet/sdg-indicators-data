rationale_interpretation: "From UNODC:\nThis indicator is widely used at national and international level to measure the most extreme form of violent crime and it also provides a direct indication of lack of security. Security from violence is a pre-requisite for individuals to enjoy a safe and active life and for societies and economies to develop freely. Intentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and this indicator has a global applicability. Monitoring intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their causes, drivers and consequences and, in the longer term, to develop effective preventive measures. \nIf data are properly disaggregated (as suggested in the ICCS), the indicator can identify the different type of violence associated with homicide: inter-personal (including partner and family-related violence), crime (including organized crime and other forms of criminal activities) and political (including terrorism, hate crime). \nThe interpretation of this indicator is straightforward also for non-specialised users.\n\n From Goal 16 TST Working Group: \n As described above, this composite indicator is comprised of two forms of violent deaths. Intentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and have global applicability, while conflict-related deaths occur in countries with ongoing conflicts/wars. Peace is a much broader concept than violent deaths, however, it is difficult to measure many aspects of peace (threats and the fear of violence, insecurity, and other forms of violence, including damages to persons and property). Deaths due to violence are universally and easily understood, are frequently monitored and are comparable with only minor discrepancies in interpretation, largely due to the finality of death. Monitoring intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their causes and consequences and, in the longer term, to develop effective prevention measures. It is based on statistical data routinely produced by law enforcement authorities and/or public health institutions, with a high degree of international comparability. Conflict-related deaths measure the direct impact of conflicts on populations in terms of losses of life."

target: "Significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere."
indicator_definition: "From UNODC:\nIntentional homicide is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent to cause death or serious injury (Source: International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes, ICCS 2015); the rate is defined as the total count of victims of intentional homicide divided by the total resident population, expressed per 100,000 population.\n\n From Goal 16 TST Working Group: \n This indicator is a composite indicator constructed by collecting two numbers, deaths from intentional homicides and deaths from conflict to measure \"peace\" with respect to target 1 ' \"Significantly reduce all forms of violence and related deaths everywhere.\" The rates of intentional homicide and conflict-related deaths should be reported separately, as combining them into one single indicator would risk conflating two distinct phenomena with differing root causes as well as varying levels of precision in measurement. Still, they are useful complements to each other as, by construction, they are exclusive and non-overlapping (ie. By design, their conjunction does not double count violent deaths). Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent of cause death or serious injury (Source: International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS), 2015). ICCS recommends that intentional homicides include: \n\tMurder \n\tHonour killing \n\tSerious assault leading to death \n\tDeath as a result of terrorist activities \n\tDowry-related killings \n\tFemicide \n\tInfanticide \n\tVoluntary manslaughter \n\tExtrajudicial killings \n\tKillings caused by excessive force by law enforcement/state officials \nConflict-related deaths refer to those deaths caused by warring parties, including, but not limited to, those caused by traditional battlefield fighting and bombardments (battle-related deaths). The term conflict-related death is broader than the term \"battlerelated death\" as it includes killings that amount to war crimes, such as targeting of civilians or of military 'hors combat', killings associated with a conflict (but not accompanied by a battle between warring parties) such as one-sided killings, pogroms and genocides. Following the ICCS definition (see homicides at left) death as a result of terrorist activities would be included in intentional homicides. For both intentional homicides and conflict-related deaths, rates are defined as the total count in deaths in a calendar year, respectively, divided by the total resident population for the year, expressed per 100,000 population. The denominator (100,000 population) has been adopted globally by law enforcement as the standard for comparable measurement."
