indicator_definition: >-
  An occupational injury refers to any personal injury, disease or death
  resulting from an occupational accident, which is an unexpected and unplanned
  occurrence, including acts of violence, arising out of or in connection with
  work which results in one or more workers incurring a personal injury, disease
  or death. A fatal occupational injury is the result of an occupational
  accident where death occurred within one year from the day of the accident,
  whereas non-fatal occupational injuries entail a loss of working time. The
  frequency rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injury are calculated as
  the number of new cases of fatal and non-fatal occupational injury during the
  reference year respectively, divided by the total number of hours worked by
  the workers in the reference group during the reference year, multiplied by
  1,000,000. The time lost due to occupational injuries refers to the total
  number of calendar days during which those persons temporarily incapacitated
  due to occupational injuries were unable to work, excluding the day of the
  accident, up to a maximum of one year.
