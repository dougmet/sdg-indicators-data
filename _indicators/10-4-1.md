rationale_interpretation: >-
  The current indicator mistakenly overlooks the internationally agreed
  definition of social protection, mainly based on cash transfers (eg pensions,
  disability, child and maternity benefits, etc). . Furthermore, coverage of
  social protection floor is already captured in indicator 1.3. In contrast, the
  alternative indicator addresses income distribution directly. 

  The rationale is to monitor progress toward Target 10.4 encompassing all three
  policies (fiscal, wage, social protection) and their impact on inequality. 

  The indicator provides and an aggregate measure of primary income inequality,
  offering insights the role that social protection can have in reducing it.
