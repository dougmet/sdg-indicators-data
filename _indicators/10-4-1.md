rationale_interpretation: "The current indicator mistakenly overlooks the internationally agreed definition of social protection, mainly based on cash transfers (eg pensions, disability, child and maternity benefits, etc). . Furthermore, coverage of social protection floor is already captured in indicator 1.3. In contrast, the alternative indicator addresses income distribution directly. \nThe rationale is to monitor progress toward Target 10.4 encompassing all three policies (fiscal, wage, social protection) and their impact on inequality. \nThe indicator provides and an aggregate measure of primary income inequality, offering insights the role that social protection can have in reducing it."
