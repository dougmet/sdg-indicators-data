rationale_interpretation: "From UNESCO:\nThe indicator is a broad measure of children's development and their preparedness to begin school. Available data for global tracking is presently collected from individual-level data reported by care-givers or teachers, which is then used to calculate an indicator that represents a composite measure across a range of agreed characteristics in the areas of health, learning and psychosocial well-being.\n\nFrom UNICEF: \nEarly childhood development sets the stage for life-long thriving. Investing in ECD is one of the most critical and cost-effective ways to improve adult health, education and productivity. ECD is equity from the start and provides a good indication of national development and efforts to improve ECD can bring about human, social and economic improvements for both individuals and societies."

indicator_name: "Proportion of children under 5 years of age who are developmentally on track in health, learning and psychosocial well-being, by sex"
target: "By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education."
indicator_definition: "From UNESCO:The percentage of children at the start of primary school, typically age 6 years in many countries, who demonstrate age-appropriate health, learning and psychosocial well-being and possess the necessary competencies and knowledge required for learning in the early primary grades. The age at which children start primary school varies across countries. This means that the indicator may broadly reflect children's development between about five and seven years of age.From UNICEF: This indicator provides the proportion of children under the age of five who are developmentally on track in health, learning and psychosocial well-being. It is calculated by dividing the number of children under the age of five who are developmentally on track in health, learning and psychosocial well-being by the total number of children under the age of five in the population."
