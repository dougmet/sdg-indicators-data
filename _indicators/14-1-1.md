# Test Indicator

The data for this indicator is test data for demonstration purposes only. This notice is part of a free text field where extra information can be added, styled using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), which allows basic things such as **bold**, _italic_, and includes [hyperlinks](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Even manual tables can be added:

| Name | Description | Number |
|:-----|:------------|-------:|
|Name1 | Free text   | 17 |
|Name2 | More text  | 0.1 |

Althought the above is not a proper data format.
