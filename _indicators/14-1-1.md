  UNEP is available to assist operationalizing these proposed indicators through
  the Global Nutrient Partnership and Marine Litter Partnership working with
  IOC, GESAMP, others etc. The earlier proposed indicator on Nitrogen Use
  Efficiency is to some extend embedded with the broader Index of Coastal
  Eutrophication (ICEP). 

  Moreover, 18 Regional Seas Conventions and Action Plans are currently working
  to develop a core set of common indicators to be used across regional seas for
  routing monitoring and reporting on the status of the marine environment.
  Several proposed indicators are relevant to 14.1, for example: (a) Chlorophyll
  a concentration as an indicator of phytoplankton biomass; (b) Locat'ons and
  frequency of algal blooms reported (c) Trends for selected priority chemicals
  'nclud'ng POPs and heavy metals; (d) Quantification and class'f'cat'on of
  beach litter items, as well as indicators related to management of marine
  pollution and debris.

  By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in
  particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient
  pollution.
