rationale_interpretation: "From UNESCO: \n Teachers play a key role in ensuring the quality of education provided. Ideally all teachers should receive adequate, appropriate and relevant pedagogical training to teach at the chosen level of education and be academically well-qualified in the subject(s) they are expected to teach. This indicator measures the share of the teaching work force which is pedagogically well-trained. \n\nFrom OECD: \nTo provide policy-relevant analysis on teachers' participation in professional development activities through a robust indicator."

indicator_definition: "From UNESCO:  The percentage of teachers by level of education taught (pre-primary, primary, lower secondary and upper secondary) who have received at least the minimum organized pedagogical teacher training pre-service and in-service required for teaching at the relevant level in a given country. The indicator should be calculated separately for public and private institutions. From OECD: Teachers (ISCED 2 level) were asked to indicate whether they had participated in any of the following activities 12 months prior to the survey: 	Courses/workshops (on subject matter or methods and/or other education-related topics). 	Education conferences or seminars (where teachers and/or researchers present their research results and discuss education problems). 	Observation visits to other schools. 	Observation visits to business premises, public organisations, or non-governmental organisations. 	In-service training courses in business premises, public organisations or non-governmental organisations. 	Qualification programmes (e.g. a degree programme). 	Participation in a network of teachers formed specifically for the professional development of teachers. 	Individual or collaborative research on a topic of professional interest. 	Mentoring and/or peer observation and coaching as part of a formal school arrangement"
