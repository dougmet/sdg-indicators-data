  Proportion of teachers in: (a) pre-primary; (b) primary; (c) lower secondary;
  and (d) upper secondary education who have received at least the minimum
  organized teacher training (e.g. pedagogical training) pre-service or
  in-service required for teaching at the relevant level in a given country.
target: >-
  By 2030, substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers, including
  through international cooperation for teacher training in developing
  countries, especially least developed countries and small island developing
  States
indicator_definition: "From UNESCO:  The percentage of teachers by level of education taught (pre-primary, primary, lower secondary and upper secondary) who have received at least the minimum organized pedagogical teacher training pre-service and in-service required for teaching at the relevant level in a given country. The indicator should be calculated separately for public and private institutions. From OECD: Teachers (ISCED 2 level) were asked to indicate whether they had participated in any of the following activities 12 months prior to the survey: \tCourses/workshops (on subject matter or methods and/or other education-related topics). \tEducation conferences or seminars (where teachers and/or researchers present their research results and discuss education problems). \tObservation visits to other schools. \tObservation visits to business premises, public organisations, or non-governmental organisations. \tIn-service training courses in business premises, public organisations or non-governmental organisations. \tQualification programmes (e.g. a degree programme). \tParticipation in a network of teachers formed specifically for the professional development of teachers. \tIndividual or collaborative research on a topic of professional interest. \tMentoring and/or peer observation and coaching as part of a formal school arrangement"

  It is important to note that national minimum training requirements can vary
  widely from one country to the next. This variability between countries
  lessens the usefulness of global tracking because the indicator would only
  show the percent reaching national standards, not whether teachers in
  different countries have similar levels of training. Further work would be
  required if a common standard for teacher training is to be applied across
  countries.
