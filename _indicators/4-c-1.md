  It is important to note that national minimum training requirements can vary
  widely from one country to the next. This variability between countries
  lessens the usefulness of global tracking because the indicator would only
  show the percent reaching national standards, not whether teachers in
  different countries have similar levels of training. Further work would be
  required if a common standard for teacher training is to be applied across
  countries.

This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator and has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts. We will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. 

Data availability within the UK is limited to England for this indicator.

The Sustainable Development Goals is a collaborative project, if you have any feedback or suggestions for data please contact us at <SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk>
