indicator_name: "Under-five mortality rate"
target: "By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births."
indicator_definition: "The probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before reaching the age of 5 years, if subject to age_ specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births. The under_five mortality rate as defined here is, strictly speaking, not a rate (i.e. the number of deaths divided by the number of population at risk during a certain period of time) but a probability of death derived from a life table and expressed as a rate per 1000 live births."

method_of_computation: "Number of deaths among children aged 0-4 years (0-59 months of age), broken down by age groups / Number of live births \nMethod of measurement \nThe most frequently used methods using the above_mentioned data sources are as follows: \nCivil registration: Number of deaths at age 0_5 and population of the same age are used to calculate death rates which are then converted into age_specific probability of dying.\nCensus and surveys: An indirect method is used based on questions to each woman of reproductive age as to how many children she has ever given birth to and how many are still alive. The Brass method and model life tables are then used to obtain an estimate of under_five and infant mortality rates. Census often includes questions on household deaths in the last 12 months, which can be used to calculate mortality estimates.\nSurveys: A direct method is used based on birth history - a series of detailed questions on each child a woman has given birth to during her lifetime. Neonatal, post_neonatal, infant, child and under_five mortality estimates can be derived from full birth history module.\nMethod of estimation \nThe United Nation Inter_agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN_IGME) produces trends of under_five mortality with a standardized methodology depending on the type and quality of source of data available. The UN IGME applies the Bayesian B_splines bias_reduction model to empirical data to derive trend estimates of under_five mortality for all countries. See the UN IGME link for details. The UN GME estimates are not necessarily the same as the official national data. \nPredominant type of statistics: adjusted and estimated."
