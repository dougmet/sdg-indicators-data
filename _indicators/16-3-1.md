rationale_interpretation: "Reporting to competent authorities is the first step for crime victims to seek justice: if competent authorities are not alerted they are not in a condition to conduct proper investigations and administer justice. However, lack of trust and confidence in the ability of the police or other authorities to provide effective redress, or objective and subjective difficulties in accessing them, can influence negatively the reporting behaviour of crime victims. As such, reporting rates provide a direct measure of the confidence of victims of crime in the ability of the police or other authorities to provide assistance and bring perpetrators to justice. Reporting rates provide also a measure of the 'dark figure' of crime, that is the proportion of crimes not reported to the police. Trends in reporting rates of violent crime can be used to monitor public trust and confidence in competent authorities on the basis of actual behaviours and not perceptions."

indicator_name: "Proportion of victims of violence in the previous 12 months who reported their victimization to competent authorities or other officially recognized conflict resolution mechanisms"
target: "Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all."
indicator_definition: "Number of victims of violent crime (physical or sexual assault) in the previous 12 months who reported their last incident to competent authorities or other officially recognized conflict resolution mechanisms, as a percentage of all victims of crime in the previous 12 months. Competent authorities includes police, prosecutors or other authorities with competencies to investigate certain crimes (such as corruption or fraud), while 'other officially recognised conflict resolution mechanisms' may include a variety of institutions with a role in the informal justice or dispute resolution (e.g. tribal or religious leaders, village elders, community leaders), provided their role is officially recognised by state authorities."
