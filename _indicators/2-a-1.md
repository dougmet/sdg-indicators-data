  agricultural productive capacity in developing countries, in particular least

indicator_definition: >-
  An Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) greater than 1 reflects a higher
  orientation towards the agriculture sector, which receives a higher share of
  government spending relative to its contribution to economic value-added. An
  AOI less than 1 reflects a lower orientation to agriculture, while an AOI
  equal to 1 reflects neutrality in a governmentâ€™s orientation to the
  agriculture sector.
