rationale_interpretation: "While it is recognized that this indicator captures only one of the gravest forms of violence against children rather than being inclusive of all forms, it can be considered a proxy indicator that reflects a key aspect of the change we want to observe in order to achieve the target of elimination of VAC. \nThe right of children to protection from all forms of violence is enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocols. 'Sexual violence' as defined in General Comment No. 13 on the Convention of the Rights of the Child, accessible here: http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/CRC.C.GC.13_en.pdf"
