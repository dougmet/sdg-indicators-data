target: "By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being."
indicator_definition: "Unconditional probability of dying between the exact ages of 30 and 70 years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases."
actual_indicator_available: 
method_of_computation: "Number of deaths between ages 30 and 70 years due to the four causes / Number of years of exposure. \nMethod of measurement \nDeaths from these four causes will be based on the following ICD codes: 100-I99, COO-C97, E10-E14 and J30-J98. \nMethod of estimation \nModelling, using multiple inputs, is often used if no complete and accurate data are available. \nAge standardization is done for comparability over time and between populations."
