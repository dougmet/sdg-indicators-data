actual_indicator_available_description: 
method_of_computation: "Number of deaths between ages 30 and 70 years due to the four causes / Number of years of exposure. Method of measurement Deaths from these four causes will be based on the following ICD codes: 100-I99, COO-C97, E10-E14 and J30-J98. Method of estimation Modelling, using multiple inputs, is often used if no complete and accurate data are available. Age standardization is done for comparability over time and between populations."
