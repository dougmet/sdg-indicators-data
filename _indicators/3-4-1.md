computation_definitions: >-
  Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or
  chronic respiratory disease. The probability of death between two ages may be
  called a mortality rate. This is the likelihood that an individual would die
  between two ages given current mortality rates at each age, calculated using
  life table methods. Probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years
  from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory
  diseases, defined as the per cent of 30-year-old-people who would die before
  their 70th birthday from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic
  respiratory disease, assuming that s/he would experience current mortality
  rates at every age and s/he would not die from any other cause of death.
computation_calculations: >-
  There are 4 steps involved in the calculation of this indicator: 1. Estimation
  of WHO life tables, based on the UN World Population Prospects 2012 revision.
  2. Estimation of cause-of-death distributions. 3. Calculation of age-specific
  mortality rates from the four main NCDs for each five-year age range between
  30 and 70. 4. Calculation of the probability of dying between the ages of 30
  and 70 years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic
  respiratory diseases.
