rationale_interpretation: "From ILO: \n The industry sector, which is largely composed of manufacturing, is central to the economy given its significant contribution to national product and employment. It impacts also other aspects of life such as health and the environment. The industry sector being a major source of job creation (directly and indirectly), the study of trends and patterns of the share and growth of employment in industry can reveal valuable information on the labour market configuration and the situation in terms of social cohesion. \n\n From UNIDO: \n This indicator represents the contribution of manufacturing in job creation. It is universally important indicator. For industrialized countries it represents sustained growth, for developing countries it shows the ability of manufacturing to absorb surplus labour from traditional sectors. Compared to the indicator 9.2.1 it measures the labour productivity ' another key indicator for measuring technological progress."

target: "Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry's share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries."
indicator_definition: "From ILO: \n This indicator is computed as the number of persons employed in the industry sector divided by total employment. Employed persons are defined as all those of working age who, during a short reference period, were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. The industry sector comprises mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction and public utilities (electricity, gas and water). \n\n From UNIDO: \n Employment is defined as a work performed for pay or profit. The value is obtained by summing up the number of employed in all manufacturing activities. The manufacturing employment indicator is presented in absolute terms as well as relative to total employment."
