indicator_name: "Forest area as a proportion of total land area"
target: "By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements."
indicator_definition: "The indicator is already included among the indicators for the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) (indicator 7.1 \"Proportion of land covered by forest\") . In order to provide a precise definition of the indicator, it is crucial to provide a definition of \"Forest\" and \"Total Land Area\". According to the FAO definitions, Forest is defined as \"land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use\". More specifically: \n\tForest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 meters. \n\tIt includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which are expected to reach a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of 5 meters or more. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management practice or natural disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5 years. Local conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is used. \n\tIt includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest. \n\tIt includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 meters. \n\tIt includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees that have, or are expected to reach, a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of at least 5 meters. \n\tIt includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless whether this area is classified as land area or not. \n\tIt includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations. \n\tIt includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover criteria are met. \n\tIt excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover. Note: Some agroforestry systems such as the \"Taungya\" system where crops are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as forest. \nTotal land area is the total surface area of a country less the area covered by inland waters, like major rivers and lakes."
