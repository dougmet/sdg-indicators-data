rationale_interpretation: "Development processes are driven by the contributions and the concerted efforts of multiple actors, including government authorities, providers of development co-operation, the private sector, civil society and others. Strong multi-stakeholder partnerships provide an enabling environment for greater development effectiveness. In this regard, mutual accountability in between the relevant stakeholders participating in development efforts can enhance the quality and strength of these partnerships. \nMutual assessment reviews are national exercises that engage both developing country authorities and providers of development co-operation, as well as other stakeholders, at the senior level in a mutual performance review. These reviews should ideally be conducted through inclusive dialogues involving a broad range of government ministries; providers of development co-operation (including bilateral, multilateral, and global initiatives); as well as other stakeholders, including parliamentarians, local governments, the private sector, and civil society organisations (referred to as \"non-executive\" stakeholders). These assessments should be done regularly (every one to two years)."

indicator_definition: "A country is considered to have a mutual assessment of progress in place when at least 4 out of 5 of the following criteria are met: 	An aid policy or partnership policy defines the country's development co-operation priorities. 	National targets for effective development co-operation exist for both the developing country government and providers of development co-operation. 	Progress has been assessed regularly and jointly by government and providers at the senior level in the past two years. 	Local governments and non-executive stakeholders have been actively involved in these reviews. 	The comprehensive results of the review have been made public in a timely manner."
