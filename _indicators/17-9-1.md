  North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation) committed to developing countries

  in developing countries to support national plans to implement all the Sustainable
  Development Goals, including through North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation

national_indicator_available: Total ODA and OOF flows to developing countries quantify

  flows from all donors for capacity building and national planning.

computation_disaggregation: This data can be disaggregated by Flow of Aid (Bilateral/Multilateral)
  and Aid Category/Description (DAC 5/CRS Code). Flow of Aid (Bilateral/Multilateral)
  can be disaggregated by other disaggregation.
comments_limitations: Figures may not sum due to rounding.   In the CRS (Creditor
  Reporting System), data on the sector of destination are recorded using 5-digit
  purpose codes.  The first three digits of the code refer to the corresponding DAC5
  sector or category.  Each CRS code belongs to one and only one DAC5 category.  Generally,
  the last two digits of the CRS purpose code are sequential and not hierarchical
  i.e., each CRS code stands for itself and can be selected individually or grouped
  to create sub-sectors. The Governance and civil society, general sector is an exception
  where purpose codes are hierarchically structured.   It is not possible to track
  directly the destination or purpose of UK funding to the general core budgets of
  the multilateral organisations. However a good indication of where UK funding goes
  is provided by OECD DAC data where the multilaterals report aid spend by country
  and sector. Therefore the multilateral data are estimates which have been calculated
  on the basis of the UK's share of the multilaterals' reported aid spending to the
  OECD.  The OECD data cover most of the main multilaterals the UK funds.  About 15%
  of the UK's core multilateral funding is not covered by the OECD data, and this
  unreported spending is allocated to the developing countries unspecified category.   More
  details on the estimates' quality are found in the Imputed multilateral share quality
  report (Statistics on International Development 2016).

computation_calculations: The raw data underlying the United Kingdom Statistics on
  International Development was summed around appropriate aid description CRS codes,
  bilateral and multilateral classification, donor recipient countries, and type of
  aid codes.   The countries receiving ODA and OOF from the UK, as shown under DAC
  Classifications ‘Least Developed Country’, ‘Other low income countries’, ‘Lower
  middle income countries and territories’ and ‘Upper middle income countries and
  territories’.

computation_definitions: "Bilateral Aid: Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by\
  \ donor countries when the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral\
  \ aid also includes aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where\
  \ the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds\
  \ will be spent on.\nMultilateral Aid: This is aid delivered in the form of core\
  \ contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations.\n\
  Purpose Codes: The DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat maintains\
  \ various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the\
  \ DAC databases.  In addition, these codes are used to classify information in the\
  \ DAC databases. The sector classification codes used can be found on the OECD website\
  \ (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm)."
