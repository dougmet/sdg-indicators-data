  Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a standard material flow accounting
  (MFA) indicator and reports the apparent consumption of materials in a
  national economy. It is calculated as direct imports (IM) of material plus
  domestic extraction (DE) of materials minus direct exports (EX) of materials
  measured in metric tonnes. DMC measures the amount of materials that are used
  in economic processes. It does not include materials that are mobilized the
  process of domestic extraction but do not enter the economic process. DMC is
  based on official economic statistics and it requires some modelling to adapt
  the source data to the methodological requirements of the MFA. The accounting
  standard and accounting methods are set out in the EUROSTAT guidebooks for MFA
  accounts in the latest edition of 2013. MFA accounting is also part of the
  central framework of the System of integrated EnvironmentalEconomic Accounts
  (SEEA).
