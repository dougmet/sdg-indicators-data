target: "By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases."
indicator_definition: "Estimated number of new and relapse TB cases (all forms of TB, including cases in people living with HIV) arising in a given year, expressed as a rate per 100 000 population."

method_of_computation: "Number of new and relapse TB cases arising in a specified time period / Number of person_years of exposure Method of measurement Direct measurement requires high_quality surveillance systems in which underreporting is negligible, and strong health systems so that underdiagnosis is also negligible; otherwise indirect estimates based on notification data and estimates of levels of underreporting and under_diagnosis. Method of estimation Estimates of TB incidence are produced through a consultative and analytical process led by WHO and are published annually. These estimates are based on annual case notifications, assessments of the quality and coverage of TB notification data, national surveys of the prevalence of TB disease and information from death (vital) registration systems.'' Estimates of incidence for each country are derived, using one or more of the following approaches depending on available data: (i) incidence = case notifications/estimated proportion of cases detected; (ii) incidence = prevalence/duration of condition; (iii) incidence = deaths/proportion of incident cases that die. Uncertainty bounds are provided in addition to best estimates. Details are available from TB impact measurement: policy and recommendations for how to assess the epidemiological burden of TB and the impact of TB control and from the online technical appendix to the WHO global tuberculosis report 2014."
