  In assessing poverty in a given country, and how best to reduce poverty
  according to national definitions, one naturally focuses on a poverty line
  that is considered appropriate for that country. Poverty lines across
  countries vary in terms of their purchasing power, and they have a strong
  economic gradient, such that richer countries tend to adopt higher standards
  of living in defining poverty. Within a country, the cost of living is
  typically higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Some countries may have
  separate urban and rural poverty lines to represent different purchasing
  powers.  Eurostat data for at-risk-of-poverty in the UK is sourced from
  Department for Work and Pensions (UK) Family Resources Survey (FRS).
