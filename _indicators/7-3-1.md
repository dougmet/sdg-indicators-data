rationale_interpretation: "Energy intensity is an indication of how much energy is used to produce one unit of economic output. It is a proxy of the efficiency with which an economy is able to use energy to produce economic output. A lower ratio indicates that less energy is used to produce one unit of output."

indicator_name: "Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP"
target: "By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency."
indicator_definition: "Primary energy intensity is obtained by dividing total primary energy supply over gross domestic product. Total primary energy supply, as defined by the IEA, is made up of production plus net imports minus international marine and aviation bunkers plus-stock changes. For international comparison purposes, GDP is measured in constant terms at purchasing power parity."
