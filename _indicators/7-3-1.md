indicator_name: Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP
target: 'By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency'
indicator_definition: >-
  Primary energy intensity is obtained by dividing total primary energy supply
  over gross domestic product. Total primary energy supply, as defined by the
  IEA, is made up of production plus net imports minus international marine and
  aviation bunkers plus-stock changes. For international comparison purposes,
  GDP is measured in constant terms at purchasing power parity.

  Reallocated energy use (in Terajoules) divided by gross value added (GVA)
  chained volume measure (CVM).
national_indicator_description: >-
  Units of direct energy used per unit of GVA (CVM), as an indicator of energy
  efficiency by sector. The Chained Volume Measures are created from the short
  term measures of output. The majority of indicators in the short term measures
  are measuring changes in output as a proxy for changes in GVA. At the
  reference year (currently 2015) the values are set equal to current price GVA
  values.
