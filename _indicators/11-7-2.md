rationale_interpretation: "Sexual harassment is a violation of women's human rights and a prohibited form of violence against women in many countries.[4] Sexually harassing conduct causes devastating physical and psychological injuries to a large percentage of women in workplaces around the world. In urban and rural areas, developed or developing countries, women and girls are constantly subjected to these forms of violence on streets, on public transport, in shopping centres and in public parks, in and around schools and workplaces, in public sanitation facilities and water and food distribution sites, or in their own neighborhoods. Such harassment reinforces the subordination of women to men in society, violates women's dignity and creates a health and safety hazard in public spaces. \nIf women and girls are to enjoy a life free from violence, policymakers need to ensure that public spaces are free from any form of violence, including sexual harassment."

indicator_name: "Proportion of persons victim of physical or sexual harassment, by sex, age, disability status and place of occurrence, in the previous 12 months"
target: "By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities."
indicator_definition: "Number of girls and women aged 15+ who were subjected to physical or sexual harassment in the last 12 months, as percentage of all women aged 15+, disaggregated by perpetrator and place of occurrence (of latest episode). Many international bodies, national legislatures and courts have prohibited sexual harassment but there is no agreed universal definition of the term.[1] Most existing studies about sexual harassment are focused on working life or educational environments and measure unwelcome and unwanted sexual acts.[1,2] Because of the lack of universal definition, data for this indicator are not comparable. Currently, comparable data exist only for the 28 European Union countries (see below for more details on existing measures)."
