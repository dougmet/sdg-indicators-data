rationale_interpretation: "This indicator is a measure of relative income poverty at the national level. It measures how far individuals are from the median standard of living, approximating a measure of social exclusion. Persons living in relative poverty often experience many other forms of social and economic disadvantage through unemployment, poor housing, inadequate health care and barriers in accessing education and economic, social, political and cultural activities, which can result from social stigmatisation."
