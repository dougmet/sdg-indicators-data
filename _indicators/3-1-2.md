  The percentage of women giving birth can be calculated by adding the number of
  maternities in NHS hospitals to the number of maternities in non-NHS
  hospitals. The number of maternities in NHS and non-NHS hospitals divided by
  the total number of maternities, multiplied by 100.
computation_numerator: Number of maternities in a medical facility

computation_definitions: >-
  A maternity is a pregnancy resulting in the birth of one or more children
  including stillbirths. A stillbirth is a baby born after 24 or more weeks
  completed gestation and which did not, at any time, breathe or show signs of
  life.
