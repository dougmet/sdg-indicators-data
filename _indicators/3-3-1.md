indicator_name: "Number of new HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected population, by sex, age and key populations"
target: "By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases."
indicator_definition: "Number of new HIV infections per 1000 person_years among the uninfected population. The incidence rate is the number of new cases per population at risk in a given time period."
actual_indicator_available: 
method_of_computation: "Number of people who are newly infected in a specific time period x 1000 / Total uninfected person_years of exposure \nMethod of measurement \nLongitudinal data on individuals are the best source of data but are rarely available for large populations. Special diagnostic tests in surveys or from health facilities can be used to obtain data on HIV incidence. \nHIV incidence can also be modelled using the Spectrum software. \nMethod of estimation \nModelling is currently used to estimate new infections and incidence. Prevalence data inform these models."
