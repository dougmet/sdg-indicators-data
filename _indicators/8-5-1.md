rationale_interpretation: "The gender wage gap measures the extent to which the wages of men differ from those of women and therefore directly addresses the target of \"equal pay for work of equal value\". When the gender pay gap equals \"0\", it denotes equality of earnings. Positive values reflect the extent to which women's earnings fall short of those received by men, where a value closer to \"100\" denotes more inequality than a value closer to \"0\". Negative values reflect the extent to which women's earnings are higher than men's."

It excludes contributions paid by employers to social security and pension schemes in respect of their employees, benefits received by employees under these schemes, and severance and termination pay."
