indicator_definition: >-
  The gender wage gap measures the relative difference between the average
  hourly earnings for men and the average hourly earnings for women. It is
  computed as the difference between the gross average hourly earnings of male
  and female employees expressed as percentage of gross average hourly earnings
  of male employees. Earnings refers to regular remuneration received from
  employers, in cash and in kind, and includes direct wages and salaries for
  time worked or work done, remuneration for time not worked (e.g. paid annual
  leave), as well as bonuses and gratuities that are regularly received. It
  excludes contributions paid by employers to social security and pension
  schemes in respect of their employees, benefits received by employees under
  these schemes, and severance and termination pay.
