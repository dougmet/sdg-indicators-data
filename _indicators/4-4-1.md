rationale_interpretation: "ICT skills determine the effective use that is made of ICTs. The lack of such skills continues to be one of the key barriers keeping people, and in particular women, from fully benefitting from the potential of information and communication technologies. This indicator will help make the link between ICT usage and impact and help measure and track the level of proficiency of ICT users."

indicator_name: "Proportion of youth and adults with information and communications technology (ICT) skills, by type of skill"
target: "By 2030, substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship."
indicator_definition: "The percentage of youth (aged 15-24 years) and adults (aged 15 years and above) that have undertaken certain computer-related activities in a given time period (e.g. last three months). Computer-related activities to measure ICT skills are as follows: 	Copying or moving a file or folder 	Using copy and paste tools to duplicate or move information within a document 	Sending e-mails with attached files (e.g. document, picture, video) 	Using basic arithmetic formulae in a spreadsheet 	Connecting and installing new devices (e.g. a modem, camera, printer) 	Finding, downloading, installing and configuring software 	Creating electronic presentations with presentation software (including text, images, sound, video or charts) 	Transferring files between a computer and other devices 	Writing a computer program using a specialized programming language A computer refers to a desktop computer, a laptop (portable) computer or a tablet (or similar handheld computer). It does not include equipment with some embedded computing abilities, such as smart TV sets, and devices with telephony as their primary function, such as smartphones. Most individuals will have carried out more than one activity and therefore multiple responses are expected. The tasks are broadly ordered from less to more complex."
