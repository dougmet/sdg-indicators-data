Data follows the UN specification for this indicator and has been indentified in collaboration with topic experts.

This indicator is Tier 3, so there are no internationally agreed standards. We have therefore provided an estimate using publically available data, but we are aware there are limitations with this method. ONS is currently working with national and international agencies to determine the most suitable method to calculate a material footprint for the UK.

The Sustainable Development Goals is a collaborative project, if you have any feedback or suggestions for data please contact us at <SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk>
