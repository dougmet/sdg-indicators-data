indicator_definition: >-
  Material footprint (MF) is the attribution of global material extraction to
  domestic final demand of a country. It is calculated as raw material
  equivalent of imports (RMEIM) plus domestic extraction (DE) minus raw material
  equivalents of exports (RMEEX). For the attribution of the primary material
  needs of final demand a global, multi-regional input-output (MRIO) framework
  is employed. The attribution method based on I-O analytical tools is described
  in detail in Wiedmann et al. 2015. It is based on the EORA MRIO framework
  developed by the University of Sydney, Australia (Lenzen et al. 2013) which is
  an internationally well-established and the most detailed and reliable MRIO
  framework available to date.
