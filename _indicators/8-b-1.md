rationale_interpretation: "Total public expenditure in social protection and employment programmes synthesizes the overall public redistributive and employment promotion efforts. Calculating it as a percentage of the national budget and the GDP allows for the analysis of its relative place in the national economy as a whole. The collective bargaining coverage rate provides a measure of the reach of collective bargaining agreements and, as such, can help in assessing and monitoring the development of industrial relations."

indicator_definition: "This indicator represents the total public expenditure in social protection and employment programmes expressed as a percentage of the national budget and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It also includes the collective bargaining coverage rate, which is calculated as the percentage of employees whose pay and conditions of employment are determined by one or more collective agreements. A collective bargaining agreement refers to \"all agreements in writing regarding working conditions and terms of employment concluded between an employer, a group of employers or one or more employers' organizations, on the one hand, and one or more representative workers' organizations, on the other\" (ILO Collective Agreements Recommendation, 1951)."
