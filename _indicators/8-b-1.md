  Total public expenditure in social protection and employment programmes
  synthesizes the overall public redistributive and employment promotion
  efforts. Calculating it as a percentage of the national budget and the GDP
  allows for the analysis of its relative place in the national economy as a
  whole. The collective bargaining coverage rate provides a measure of the reach
  of collective bargaining agreements and, as such, can help in assessing and
  monitoring the development of industrial relations.

indicator_definition: >-
  This indicator represents the total public expenditure in social protection
  and employment programmes expressed as a percentage of the national budget and
  the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It also includes the collective bargaining
  coverage rate, which is calculated as the percentage of employees whose pay
  and conditions of employment are determined by one or more collective
  agreements. A collective bargaining agreement refers to "all agreements in
  writing regarding working conditions and terms of employment concluded between
  an employer, a group of employers or one or more employers' organizations, on
  the one hand, and one or more representative workers' organizations, on the
  other" (ILO Collective Agreements Recommendation, 1951).
