indicator_definition: >-
  The mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of
  hygiene (exposure to unsafe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for All (WASH)
  services) as defined as the number of deaths from unsafe water, unsafe
  sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe WASH services) in a year,
  divided by the population, and multiplied by 1,000,000.
national_indicator_available: >-
  Deaths attributable to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene focusing on
  inadequate WASH services, expressed per 1,000,000 population.
national_indicator_description: >-
  The indicator expresses the number of deaths from inadequate water, sanitation
  and hygiene (with focus on WASH services) which could be prevented by
  improving those services and practices. It is based on both the WASH service
  provision in the country, as well as the related health outcomes, and
  therefore provides important information on the actual disease caused by the
  risks measured in 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3.

comments_limitations: >-
  Data rely on (a) statistics on WASH services (6.1, 6.2 and 6.3), which are
  well assessed in almost all countries, and (b) data on deaths. Data on deaths
  are also widely available from countries from death registration data or
  sample registration systems, which are certainly feasible systems. Such data
  are crucial for improving health and reducing preventable deaths in countries.
  The main limitation is that not all countries do have such registration
  systems to date, and data need to be completed with other type of information.

  Definitions sourced from “User Guide to Mortality Statistics” (NOMIS)

  Base populations: The population estimates used to calculate mortality rates
  are mid-year estimates of the resident population of England and Wales based
  on the Census of Population. Our mid-year population estimates are updated
  figures using the most recent census, allowing for births, deaths, net
  migration and ageing of the population.

  The population estimates used are the most up-to-date when rates are produced.
  The specific population estimates used to calculate rates are detailed
  alongside published tables. Sometimes it is necessary to revise mortality
  rates following population estimate revisions. Any revisions to mortality
  rates are footnoted on tables. Further information on population estimates,
  and their methodology is available.

  Final cause of death: The conditions mentioned on the death certificate are
  used to derive an underlying cause of death. In some cases, more information
  on cause of death may become available at a later stage after the death has
  been registered, such that the underlying cause may be subsequently amended.
  Around 0.1% of deaths have their underlying cause amended (Table 6). This
  amended or final cause is used in mortality statistics. Sometimes the later
  information becomes available only after the annual extract has been taken.
  Users with access to individual records of deaths as shown in the public
  record (which is never amended) may consequently find some differences with
  published statistics.

We are still looking for a suitable data source for this indicator. Please contact us if you think you can help by emailing <a href="mailto:SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk">SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk</a>.

In the future we plan to split this category so we can show you which indicators represent data gaps are currently in development and which are still left to look at.
