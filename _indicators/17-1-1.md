rationale_interpretation: "The headline measure presents the total tax revenues received by the national government during the year, expressed as a percentage of GDP ' i.e., total national income. Taxes include personal and corporate income taxes, taxes on property, value added taxes, excise taxes, tariffs, customs duties and social security contributions. The tax to GDP ratio is the leading indicator to estimate the financial domestic means of a government to conduct its programme, to raise resources to supply physical infrastructure, public goods and services. The tax to GDP ratio supports the development of effective tax systems and is an essential feature of a successful governance framework. Normalising the data, by dividing total revenues by GDP, enables easy comparisons across countries Comparable and consistent tax statistics, such as the tax to GDP ratio, facilitate transparent policy dialogue and provide policy makers with an important tool to assess alternative fiscal reforms and to undertake relevant policy actions."

target: "Strengthen domestic resource mobilization, including through international support to developing countries, to improve domestic capacity for tax and other revenue collection."
indicator_definition: "Total taxes as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In the OECD classification the term \"taxes\" is defined as compulsory unrequited payments to general government. The definition of government follows that of the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA). The important parts of the SNA's conceptual framework and its definitions of the various sectors of the economy have been reflected in the OECD's classification of taxes. The data are predominantly recorded on an accrual basis. Data on tax revenues are recorded without offsets for the administrative expenses connected with tax collection. GDP also follows the definition used in the SNA. The methodology used in compiling the OECD's internally comparable revenue statistics has been carefully developed and refined through consultation with national statisticians and tax policy makers for more than 40 years. It continues to evolve."
