rationale_interpretation: "From Population Division/DESA, United Nations: \nThe birth rate among adolescents younger than age 15 is more meaningfully measured for ages 12-14 as births among 10-11 year olds are rare and a rate with respect to the 10-14 year old population would not correctly reflect the increased risk of early childbearing by age."

indicator_name: "Adolescent birth rate (aged 10-14 years; aged 15-19 years) per 1,000 women in that age group"
target: "By 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes."
indicator_definition: "From WHO: \nAnnual number of births to women aged 15-19 years per 1000 women in that age group. It is also referred to as the age_specific fertility rate for women aged 15-19 years. \n\nFrom Population Division/DESA, United Nations: \nMetadata on the definition, method of computation and other information for the adolescent birth (15- 19) are included in the MDG database as this was an indicator (5.4) used for global monitoring of MDG target 5.B. Achieve, by 2015, universal access to reproductive health. Please see http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mdg/Metadata.aspx The definition and method of computation for the birth rate among 10-14 year olds are similar to that for the birth rate among 15-19 year olds."

method_of_computation: "From WHO: \nNumber of live births to women aged 15-19 years / Exposure to childbearing by women aged 15-19 years \nMethod of measurement \nThe adolescent birth rate is generally computed as a ratio. The numerator is the number of live births to women aged 15-19 years, and the denominator is an estimate of exposure to childbearing by women aged 15-19 years. The numerator and the denominator are calculated differently for civil registration and survey and census data. \nCivil registration: In the case of civil registration the numerator is the registered number of live births born to women aged 15-19 years during a given year, and the denominator is the estimated or enumerated population of women aged 15-19 years.'' \nSurvey data: In the case of survey data, the adolescent birth rate is generally computed on the basis of retrospective birth histories. The numerator refers to births to women who were 15-19 years of age at the time of the birth during a reference period before the interview, and the denominator to person_years lived between the ages of 15 and 19 years by the interviewed women during the same reference period. Whenever possible, the reference period corresponds to the five years preceding the survey. The reported observation year corresponds to the middle of the reference period. For some surveys, no retrospective birth histories are available and the estimate is based on the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the survey.'' \nCensus data: With census data, the adolescent birth rate is generally computed on the basis of the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the enumeration. The census provides both the numerator and the denominator for the rates. In some cases, the rates based on censuses are adjusted for under_registration based on indirect methods of estimation. For some countries with no other reliable data, the own_children method of indirect estimation provides estimates of the adolescent birth rate for a number of years before the census (See: http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Metadata.aspx, accessed 19 October 2009.) \nIf numbers are available, adolescent fertility at ages under 15 years can also be computed. \nMethod of estimation \nThe United Nations Population Division compiles and updates data on adolescent fertility rates for MDG monitoring. Estimates based on civil registration are provided when the country reports at least 90% coverage and there is reasonable agreement between civil registration estimates and survey estimates. Survey estimates are provided only when there is no reliable civil registration. Given the restrictions of the United Nations MDG database, only one source is provided by year and country. In such cases precedence is given to the survey programme conducted most frequently at the country level, with other survey programmes using retrospective birth histories, census and other surveys in that order. (See: http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Metadata.aspx, accessed 19 October 2009.) \n\nFrom Population Division/DESA, United Nations: \nMetadata on the definition, method of computation and other information for the adolescent birth (15- 19) are included in the MDG database as this was an indicator (5.4) used for global monitoring of MDG target 5.B.
