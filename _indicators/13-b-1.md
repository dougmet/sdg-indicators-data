rationale_interpretation: "As the effects of climate change are becoming more evident and acute, the need for effective climate services is greater than ever before. Climate services underpin climate action and achieving SDGs. Nevertheless, the GFCS High level Task Force had identified 70 countries that do not yet have sufficient capacities to develop and use climate services. This is a major focus of the GFCS. This indicator contributes and supports the achievement of several targets such as 1.5, 2.1, 6.1, 6.4, 6.5, 7.1, 9.1, 11.3, 11.5, 12.8, 13.1, 13.2, 14.2, 15.3."
