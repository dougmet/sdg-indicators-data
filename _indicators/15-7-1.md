rationale_interpretation: "The indicator measures the law enforcement effort to combat poaching and illegal trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna, with seizures representing law enforcement action. Since trends in seizures are meaningless without some indication of trends in demand, import and export permits issued (required under CITES) are used as an indicator of legal market demand. \nComparing seizures of wildlife and wildlife products and legal trade intends to measure the last part of the target \"address both demand and supply of illegal wildlife products\"."

target: "Take urgent action to end poaching and trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna and address both demand and supply of illegal wildlife products."
indicator_definition: "The proportion of traded wildlife that was poached or illicitly trafficked is defined as the proportion of total wildlife seizures to the total wildlife traded as evidenced by export permits issued. The different wildlife products traded and seized are compared by applying an aggregation measure. \nConcepts: \nWildlife is defined as protected wild species of flora and fauna which are legally traded and included in the CITES Appendices. With the exception of Appendix I species, most protected wildlife is legally traded. \nPoaching is defined as the illegal taking of wildlife for the purposes of international trade. \nIllicit trafficking is defined as illegal import or export of wildlife. \nExport Permits are required to export CITES-listed wildlife by every Member State (defined in Article VI of CITES, which regulates the information export permit shall contain and in Resolution Conf. 8.5, in which the Conference of the Parties to the Convention agreed on the information to be included in an export permit. \nSeizures are the result of confiscation of wildlife or wildlife products by national law enforcement authorities. Seizures occur when law enforcement authorities have suspicion that the wildlife or wildlife product they encounter is obtained or trafficked illegally. Depending on where, when and why national law enforcement authorities seize wildlife and wildlife products, the information about the seized items corresponds more or less to the variables defined by CITES in the export permit. A minimum prerequisite of a seizure report is naming the species (or lowest taxonomic level possible) of the seized specimen. Also the quantity of specimens and the unit of measure are ideally included, as well as the trade term defining the product that is seized. \nAggregation measure. The weight and number of seizures cannot be used as an indicator of poaching, because it is meaningless to compare or add the different wildlife products. Since legal trade does occur among all species products, including those listed on CITES Appendix I, it is possible to derive standard prices from import records in a common market and to determine, for example, what the relative value of rosewood is as compared to dried seahorses."
