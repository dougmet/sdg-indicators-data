indicator_name: >-
  Proportion of water bodies (area) in a country with good ambient water quality
  compared to all water bodies in the country.
target: >-
  By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and
  minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the
  proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and
  safe reuse globally
indicator_definition: >-
  Proportion of water bodies (area) in a country with good ambient water quality
  compared to all water bodies in the country. 'Good' indicates an ambient water
  quality that does not damage ecosystem function and human health according to
  core ambient water quality indicators. Concept: Water quality is estimated
  based on a core set of five determinands that inform on major water quality
  impairments present in many parts of the world: total dissolved solids (TDS);
  percentage dissolved oxygen (% DO); dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN);
  dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP); and Escherichia coli (E. coli). As
  monitoring capacities and coverage vary between countries, a monitoring ladder
  is proposed. On the first rung, the number of determinands not meeting
  national water quality guidelines based on the existing monitoring sites are
  used to estimate the water quality. On the second rung, a water quality index
  is used to combine the determinand values in a statistically more robust
  manner, and the monitoring coverage increased. On consecutive rungs, the
  monitoring coverage can be step-wise increased and complementary determinands
  covering additional aspects of ambient water quality can be included depending
  on the national capacities and requirements enabling the indicator to inform
  on the status of ambient water quality in a more comprehensive way.
