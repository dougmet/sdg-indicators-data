rationale_interpretation: "The reduction of average tariff on key sector as agriculture can represent a proxy of the level of commitment of developed country to improve market access conditions. As it was done for MDG 8.7, the term \"key sector\" has to be interpreted as those sectors of particular interest for LDCs and developing countries exports. The list of key sectors used by the MDG indicator 8.7 (i.e. agriculture, textile and clothing) might have to be reviewed."

indicator_name: "Average tariffs faced by developing countries, least developed countries and small island developing States"
target: "Realize timely implementation of duty-free and quota-free market access on a lasting basis for all least developed countries, consistent with World Trade Organization decisions, including by ensuring that preferential rules of origin applicable to imports from least developed countries are transparent and simple, and contribute to facilitating market access."
indicator_definition: "Similar calculations were already used for the calculation of MDG 8.7 (Average tariffs imposed by developed countries on agricultural products and textiles and clothing from developing countries). For reference purposes see the Millennium Development Goals Report 2015 available at http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/2015_MDG_Report/pdf/MDG%202015%20rev%20(July%201).pdf (p. 64)"
