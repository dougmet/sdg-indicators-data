rationale_interpretation: "In order to be effective and accountable, intuitions must be responsive to the needs of the population. This indicator will require the use of perception-based population surveys and will collect relevant data on the lived experience of individuals seeking access to and obtaining basic public services, such as health care, education, water and sanitation, as well as services provided by the police and judicial system."
