indicator_name: "Global food loss index"
target: "By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses."
indicator_definition: "The indicator measures the totality of losses occurring from the time at which production of an agricultural product is recorded until it reaches the final consumer as food. While calculated on a quantity basis, it is subsequently transformed to dietary energy supplies (in kcal) per capita allowing consistent aggregation and then indexed. The indicator will be calculated on an annual frequency broken down by country and commodity."
