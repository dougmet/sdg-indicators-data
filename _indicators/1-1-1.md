rationale_interpretation: "This indicator combines the poverty indicator under the first target (1a) of the MDGs on the eradication of poverty with the corresponding working indicator for monitoring the second target (1b) of the MDGs on decent work. By combining poverty status with employment status, the concept of the working poor is captured, which aims to measure how many workers, despite being in employment, live in poverty."
