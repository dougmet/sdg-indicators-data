indicator_name: "Proportion of countries where the legal framework (including customary law) guarantees women's equal rights to land ownership and/or control"
target: "Undertake reforms to give women equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, financial services, inheritance and natural resources, in accordance with national laws."
indicator_definition: "The precise definition of this indicator is: \"The legal framework includes special measures to guarantee women's equal rights to landownership and control\". \nThe indicator monitors reforms that give women equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to ownership and control over land. More specifically, the indicator allows for monitoring progress towards gender equity through the adoption of women-specific measures to promote women's secure rights to land. The indicator has a scoring system from 0 to 4, which signals the stage in the policy/legal framework working towards legal reform, as follows: \n\tScore 0: Absence of the indicator in the legal framework \n\tScore 1: A policy is being developed \n\tScore 1.5: A policy is in place \n\tScore 2: A draft legislation is to be submitted for deliberations \n\tScore 3: The indicator appears in primary law \n\tScore 4: The indicator appears in multiple legal instruments \nN/A: Not applicable \nThe indicator considers whether: \n\tNational legal framework gives priority to women heads of household under land distribution and titling programmes; \n\tNational legal framework establishes targeted government funds to increase women access to land; \n\tJoint titling of private property (or user rights) is compulsory in the registration process for husband and wife; The proposed indicator is supported by a number of international instruments, including: \n\tMaputo Protocol, Article 19(c): \n\t\"States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to [...] promote women's access to and control over productive resources such as land and guarantee their right to property\"; \n\tIt is in line with the Voluntary Guidelines for Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests (VGGT). Namely: \n\t\tPrinciple 4 on Gender equality: \"Ensure the equal right of women and men to the enjoyment of all human rights, while acknowledging differences between women and men and taking specific measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality when necessary. States should ensure that women and girls have equal tenure rights and access to land, fisheries and forests independent of their civil and marital status.\"\n\t\tSection 25.6: \"Special procedures should, where possible, provide the vulnerable, including widows and orphans, with secure access to land, fisheries and forests.\""
