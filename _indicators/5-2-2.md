  Violence against women and girls is one of the most pervasive human rights
  abuses in the world today and takes place in all countries. In order to
  eradicate violence against women and girls, it is necessary to measure its
  prevalence in all its forms. 

  By measuring the prevalence of sexual violence by persons other than an
  intimate partner, this indicator complements the other priority indicator in
  5.2 (i.e. the proportion of ever-partnered women and girls aged 15+ subjected
  to physical, sexual and psychological violence by a current or former intimate
  partner, in the last 12 months, by form of violence and age). 

  Furthermore, by disaggregating this indicator by place of occurrence and
  perpetrator, this indicator would measure sexual violence in the workplace and
  in public spaces. 

   Intimate partner violence includes abuse perpetrated by a current or former partner within the context of marriage, cohabitation or any other formal or informal union. Violence directed at girls and women is the most common form of gender-based violence.

  Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and
  private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of
  exploitation.
indicator_definition: "Number of girls and women aged 15+ who were subjected to sexual violence by persons other than an intimate partner, as percentage of all girls and women aged 15+, disaggregated by age and place of occurrence. Sexual violence as defined in para 60 of the UN Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women: Statistical Surveys [1]: ... is any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behavior that is imposed on someone. It includes act of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts with a woman without her consent, sexual harassment, verbal abuse, threats, exposure, unwanted touching, incest, etc. A minimum list of acts of sexual violence, which should be expanded depending on the specific country context, consists of the following: (a) Rape: Refers to engaging in the non-consensual vaginal, anal, or oral penetration of a sexual nature of the body of another person with any bodily part or object, including through the use of physical violence and by putting the victim in a situation where she cannot say no or complies because of fear; (b) Attempted rape: Refers to attempting to have non-consensual sexual intercourse through the use of force or threats; (c) Other sexual acts: Refers to: \tIntimate touching without consent \tSexual acts other than intercourse forced by money \tSexual acts other than intercourse obtained through threats of physical violence \tSexual acts other than intercourse obtained through threats to the well-being of family members \tUse of force or coercion to obtain unwanted sexual acts or any sexual activity that the female partner finds degrading or humiliating \tOther acts of sexual violence. The indicator specifically considers the following: 1) sexual violence (separately from physical violence); 2) women and girls aged 15+ who were subjected to sexual violence; and 3) by perpetrators who are persons other than an intimate partner.  This indicator provides the proportion of ever-partnered girls and women aged 15+ subjected to physical, sexual or psychological violence in the last 12 months by a current or former intimate partner. It is calculated by dividing the number of ever-partnered girls and women aged 15+ subjected to physical, sexual or psychological in the last 12 months by a current or former intimate partner by the total number of ever-partnered girls and women aged 15+ in the population."

  This table contains estimated volume numbers based on both the FBI UCR
  Program's legacy and revised definitions of rape.  In 2013, the FBI UCR
  Program initiated the collection of rape data under a revised definition and
  removed the term “forcible” from the offense name. 

  Column heading Year - is the year the data represents.

  Column Heading Revised Rape Definitions are the estimates of data collected
  under the revised rape definition: Penetration, no matter how slight, of the
  vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex
  organ of another person, without the consent of the victim. (This includes the
  offenses of rape, sodomy, and sexual assault with an object as converted from
  data submitted via the National Incident-Based Reporting System [NIBRS].) 

  Column Heading Legacy Rape Definition are the estimates of data collected
  under the legacy rape definition: The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly
  and against her will

  Indicator data on sexual assault is available in the National Incident-Based
  Reporting System (NIBRS); however,  NIBRS currently represents less than 30%
  of the nation's population and nonresponse cannot be modeled to adjust for
  bias because statistical sampling methodologies were not used.
us_method_of_computation: ' Agencies submit data based on only one of these definitions. Within each population group size, the proportion of female rape victims was calculated from all NIBRS reports of rape, sodomy, and sexual assault with an object. For agencies that reported using the revised definition, the actual number of reported rapes was decreased by the calculated proportion to arrive at an estimate for the number of rapes using the legacy definition. Conversely, for agencies that reported using the legacy definition, the actual number of reported rapes was increased by the inverse of the proportion to arrive at an estimate for the number of rapes using the revised definition.  '

  In 2013, the Summary UCR definition of rape was changed to “penetration, no
  matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral
  penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the
  victim.” The new definition updated the 80-year-old historical definition of
  rape which was “carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will.”
  Effectively, the revised definition expands rape to include both male and
  female victims and offenders, and reflects the various forms of sexual
  penetration understood to be rape, especially nonconsenting acts of sodomy,
  and sexual assaults with objects.
