indicator_name: "Research and development expenditure as a proportion of GDP"
target: "Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including, by 2030, encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers per 1 million people and public and private research and development spending."
indicator_definition: "The OECD Frascati Manual provides the relevant definitions for research and experimental development, gross domestic expenditure on R&D and researchers. \nResearch and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications. (FM '63) \nIntramural expenditures are all expenditures for R&D performed within a statistical unit or sector of the economy during a specific period, whatever the source of funds. (FM '358) \nResearchers are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge, products, processes, methods and systems and also in the management of the projects concerned. (FM '301) \nAlthough an OECD manual, the application is global. The Frascati Manual is currently under revision, with the next edition to be released in October 2015. The new edition of the Manual will be a truly global manual. There will be some changes to the definitions provided above, but these are not substantial."
