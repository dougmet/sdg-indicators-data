indicator_name: "Proportion of sustainable development indicators produced at the national level with full disaggregation when relevant to the target, in accordance with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics"
target: "By 2020, enhance capacity-building support to developing countries, including for least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts."
indicator_definition: "The ability of National Statistical Offices and other bodies within countries to report on the diversity of SDG indicators is itself a measure of capacity, particularly when we think about the eventual complexity of the indicator framework as well as the points of disaggregation. Right now, a number of the existing indicators are calculated or modeled at global level, and the purpose of this indicator is to measure the shift in that calculation process to the national level. \nDisaggregation would be assessed on the basis of the language of target 17.18, as well as the metadata and agreements on disaggregation for each indicator itself. The baseline and targets for this indicators will be determined in a later stage using trend data on the MDGs reporting and independent assessments of current capacity of countries for reporting towards the final results framework and indicators for the SDGs."
