rationale_interpretation: "NEET provides a measure of youth who are outside the educational system, not in training and not in employment, and thus serves as a broader measure of potential youth labour market entrants than youth unemployment. A high NEET rate as compared with the youth unemployment rate could mean that a large number of youth are discouraged workers, or do not have access to education or training. A high NEET rate among females as compared with males is often an indication of gender imbalances, with female youth engaged in household chores such as washing clothes, cooking, cleaning and taking care of siblings."
