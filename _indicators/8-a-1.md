  The DAC defines Official Development Assistance (ODA) as “those flows to
  countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to
  multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies,
  including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii)
  each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic
  development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is
  concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent
  (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent). See
  http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm

  Other official flows (OOF),excluding officially supported export credits, are
  defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the
  conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed
  at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional. See
  http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf, Para 24.

  Aid for Trade is captured in the CRS through sector codes in the 331 series
  and the aid for trade marker. see here:
  http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm. ‘All
  donors’ refers to DAC donors, non-DAC donors and multilateral organisations.
