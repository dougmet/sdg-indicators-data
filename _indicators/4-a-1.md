indicator_definition: 'The percentage of schools by level of education (primary, lower secondary and upper secondary) with access to the given facility or service. Internet for pedagogical purposes is defined as Internet that is available for enhancing teaching and learning and is accessible by pupils. Internet for pedagogical purposes is defined as a worldwide interconnected computer network, which provides pupils access to a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and carries e-mail, news, entertainment and data files, irrespective of the device used (i.e. not assumed to be only via a computer) and thus can also be accessed by mobile telephone, tablet, PDA, games machine, digital TV etc.). Access can be via a fixed narrowband, fixed broadband, or via mobile network. Basic drinking water is defined as a functional drinking water source (MDG ''improved'' categories) on or near the premises and water points accessible to all users during school hours. Basic sanitation facilities are defined as functional sanitation facilities (MDG ''improved'' categories) separated for males and females on or near the premises. Basic handwashing facilities are defined as functional handwashing facilities, soap (or ash) and water available to all girls and boys. The component on adapted infrastructure and materials is yet to be developed.'
