rationale_interpretation: "The indicator captures the degree of implementation of all main elements of IWRM. It supports decision making at the country level, as results can be disaggregated to review progress on different aspects. This will strengthen stakeholder participation, transparency and accountability. It also enables countries to identify barriers to progress and ways in which they can be addressed. It also facilitates coherence between the various targets within the water and sanitation goal by supporting water monitoring, planning and evaluation, as well as associated capacity building and thus the achievement of the overall water goal."

indicator_name: "Degree of integrated water resources management implementation (0- 100)"
target: "By 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate."
indicator_definition: "This indicator reflects the extent to which integrated water resources management (IWRM) is implemented. It takes into account the various users and uses of water with the aim of promoting positive social, economic and environmental impacts on all levels, including transboundary, where appropriate."

actual_indicator_available_description: 
method_of_computation: "National surveys are structured in 4 components: policies, institutions, management tools, and financing. Within each component there are questions with defined response options giving scores of 0- 100. Questions scores are aggregated to the component level, and each component score is equally weighted to give an aggregated indicator score of 0-100. The method builds on official UN IWRM status reporting, from 2008 and 2012, of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation from the UN World Summit for Sustainable Development (1992)."
